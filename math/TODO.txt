### Move to an n-gram predictor that uses PPM to combine shot- and long-term predictions

- low-order markov chains are highly general but don't give enough weight to 
  context
- higher-order markov chains capture subtler, longer-term patterns, but fail
  to generalize and see short patterns.

In http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas03dm/papers/AMIR_PearceMullensiefenWiggins_2010.pdf
they propose keeping track of all n-grams (markov-chains with order 0-to-N, for 
some maximum N), and weighting the predictions in some way that uses higher-order
predictions when they're available, but falls back on lower-order ones otherwise.

- Recursive Backoff?
- Interpolated Backoff?
