### REFACTORING

fake_sensor_vectors is now huge.  figure out a different strategy...
	- Don't load all >50MB of events when running specs
	- I also want to load / not load different styles easily.

Put a 'context' member on each note that points to shared context hash (***)
	- this could be different for different phrases
	- it could contain harmonic info, intended surprise levels, etc.

### BETTER IMPROVS

How can the improvs contain repeated motifs?
	- use two copies of every critic.  One is trained on long-term inputs.  The
	  other is reset at the beginning of each listening, and is used to generate
	  piece-specific expectations
	- generate ad hoc, instead of rigidly left-to-right?
	- add motif critic that looks for good places to insert these motifs and
	  creates expectations for them
	- create temporary dups of all critics and train them heavily on the motifs.
	- have a few "spare" critics in each generator that are looking for structure and which
	  don't persist their training?
	- look for surprising notes & assume those are where motifs are anchored?

Look at aggregate stats:
	- pitch range
	- jumps vs. steps
	- surprise envelopes
	- overall shape of line 

Explore ways to make it harmonically intelligible
	- critic for {pitch class set (polyphonic, harmonic context); last note}->{next note}
		- this critic would be idle/mute for monophonic inputs
		- this is easier in 4-part choral-style midi files, because they're separated into
		  tracks.  In the general case (live, human performer), we'd need a stream
		  splitter.  Could be a fancier one that can parse things like Bach prelude 1. Or
		  could just take the highest active note at any point in time.
	- Like duration, if we have notes from other tracks, we can use that as polyphonic
	  context. If we don't, we could fall back on scalar context.

Have PitchAndPitchClassSetCritic do more sophisticated weighting, based on 
	- beat strength

Change to planning based on time or number of beats (vs. number of notes)

I'd like to build layers of assumptions and fall-back as needed.
	- First assume we're doing standard Western cannon.  
	- Then if that fails, assume there's still chords and scales.  
	- Then if that fails, look for consistent pitch class sets.  
	- And if all else fails ... no idea.

### MORE RESPONSIVE / INTERACTIVE

Mimic the stimulus's: meter
Mimic the stimulus's: phrase length
Mimic the stimulus's: tempo
Mimic the stimulus's: pitch classes

### INTRODUCING FARG ARCHITECTURE

Explore FARG architecture for improvising better endings

Use rule-based FARG architectures to go apply happiness / unhappiness values throughout a finished improv and rip the parts

Use FARG techniques to look for structure / repeated patterns in the stimulus
