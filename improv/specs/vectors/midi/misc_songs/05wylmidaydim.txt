1.
Now in the summer of life sweetheart,
You say love but me,
Gladly I give all my heart to you,
Throbbing with ecstacy.
But last night I saw while a-dreaming,
The future old and gray,
And I wondered if you'll love me then dear,
Just as you do today.

REFRAIN [sung after each verse]
Will you love me in December as do in May,
Will you love in the good old fashioned way?
When my hair has all turned gray,
Will you kiss me then, and say,
That you love me in December as do in May?

2.
You say the glow on my cheek sweetheart,
Is like the rose so sweet;
But when the bloom of fair youth has flown,
Then will our lips still meet?
When life's setting sun fades away dear,
And all is said and done,
Will your arms still entwine and caress me,
Will our hearts beat as one?
