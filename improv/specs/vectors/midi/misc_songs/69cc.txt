1.
How I’ve loved thee, Cora Carr!
Still I hear thy joyous tone,
And thy mem’ry like a star
O’er the dreary past has shone,
Still I hear thy laughter ringing
In my memry’s haunted bowers,
While a thousand dreams are bringing
Back those happy, happy hours.

CHORUS (may be omitted) [sung after each VERSE]
Still I hear thy laughter ringing
In my mem’ry’s haunted bowers,
While a thousand dreams are bringing back
Those happy happy hours.

2.
Oft I’ve seen thee, Cora Carr,
In the visions of the night,
But those visions fled a far
At the dawn of morninglight,
But a day will soon be dawning,
Where no garish sun will shine,
In that blissful heavenly morning
May I then not call thee mine.

3.
What though weary years have flown,
Cora, since I left thy side,
And I’m journ’ying on alone,
To the silent Stygian tide;
Still thy presence will be near me,
As I cross that gloomy steam,
And in heaven thy love will cheer me;
Then my bliss will be no dream.
