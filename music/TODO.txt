Phrase detection
	- Try moving 'split phrase' up a level and choose the spot before arbitrarily
	  choosing a phrase. This is probably what's causing crappy phrases to 
	  disintegrate into singletons
	- Track each phrase's unhappiness along each of the score dimensions. This 
	  would give a better sorted set of tactic opporunities
	- Don't choose tactics as randomly.  Create a prioritized list of tactics 
	  based on the tactic opportunities.  Represent each opportunity as a lambda
	  with parameters ready to go

Refactor beat_position to just point to / contain a meter
