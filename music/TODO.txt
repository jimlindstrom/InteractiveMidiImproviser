It still surprises the hell out of of me that this isn't TRIVIAL. "My Bonnie 
lies over the ocean" is practically verbatim AAAA BA'BA'.  Why isn't that a
trivial win?

Phrase List Scoring
	- It could be helpful to run the listeners and incorporate surprise into
	  DistInterval.
	- Similarity is currently looked at on a note-by-note basis. But phrases
	  exhibit patterns of similarity that are not evident in simple note-by-note
	  comparisons.
		- Instead of looking at overall phrase duration and penalizing the outliers,
		  we could view duration as a property of phrase. It's not that we want to
		  penalize outliers from the mean; it's more that we want to penalize 
		  phrases which bear no similarity (including duration) to others.
		- What kinds of properties do phrases have? Overall duration, overall 
		  contour/shape, weighted pitch class set, duration set, 1st order markov
		  stats, surprise
	- Change the way similarity factors into scoring. Right now, the algorithm 
	  is filtering low similarity scores and summing the remainder. That means 
	  that a phrase candidate with mediocre similarity to every other phrase is
	  treated just as high as a phrase with above-average similarity to exactly
	  one other phrase.
	- Don't let there be instances of phrase candidates A,B (consecutively) and
	  then multiple other occurances of A,B (consecutively). These are probably
	  a single phrase that's has two different endings. [this rule is too black-
	  and-white, and would lump the entire Blues verse into a single phrase.]
