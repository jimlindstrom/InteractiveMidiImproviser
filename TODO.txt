New Critic: tactus/meter/time sig
	Communicate through:
		- an 'analysis' hash on each note
		- a 'context' member on each note that points to shared context hash
			- this could be different for different phrases
			- it could contain harmonic info, intended surprise levels, etc.
	This would let:
		- Critics communicate in a pseudo-pub/sub way
		- MeterCritic could patch in a meter if there isn't one
			- alternatively, it could be hard-coded as a response to the stimulus
	This would avoid:
		- having to make the various generators and listeners know what members of critics to call
	
	In progress:
		- Trying to modify duration critic to make it look at {beat position (symbol), duration (symbol)}
		- with the hope that this would cause more rhythmically intelligible improv.
		- Need to figure out a place to invoke the meter detection.  A bulk critic?
		- Need to modify duration critic

New Critic: phrase length
New Critic: tempo

New Critic: chord/scale (w/ underlying chord generation too)
New Critic: key sig (look at prevalence of all notes so far. match to existing schemes)
New Critic: overall shape of line

Some sort of ending prediction
	- factor oracle
	- markov chain based on [cur note; # notes left] to predict [next note]

Change to planning based on time, vs. # notes
