# Post-mortem

This project was attempting to accomplish too much. I have broken out two smaller projects that I think are useful on their own:

* [jimlindstrom/markov](https://github.com/jimlindstrom/markov) (Advanced Markov modeling)
* [jimlindstrom/music_ir](https://github.com/jimlindstrom/music_ir) (Music Information Retrieval)

The top-level program, here, was attempting to use these two sub-projects to interactively listen and improvise/respond with a user. I may tackle that again some day, but I need to improve hte performance of the music_ir algorithms first.
