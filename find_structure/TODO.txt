### Objecive

NO: Structurally segment the melody into a decomposable tree
	- this is not what I am trying to do.  I don't believe that every note
	  must fulfill a structural role.  I believe that the ear is retaining 
	  enough information to make that calculation.  I believe that the lay 
	  ear reduces information pretty radically and hears approximate contours
	  (envelopes), fuzzy intervals, etc.  

YES: Identify repeated elements or groups of elements.
	- This is more what I'm after.  I believe that the note-by-note stats
	  that are currently driving the improv engine are insufficient to 
	  structure the piece.  I'm merely looking for some top-level templates
	  that can be used as a skeleton to exert top-down structure pressure on
	  the bottom-up, note-by-note statistics currently being used to generate
	  improvisations

### How to represent notes

Pour more analysis (symbols) back into the notes themselves:
	- qIOI
	- fuzzy qIOI (short / med / long)
	- pitch
	- pitch class
	- pitch class distance (along circle of 5ths)
	- index in pitch class set
	- interval 
	- fuzzy interval (direction & step/jump)
and use these dimensions to compare similarity / role 

### Architecture

What does a group look like?  
	- Just an array?
	- A list of slots/roles?
	- Maybe groups start out as arrays, but can get promoted into themes, which
	  describe the role of each item in the array, or describe how each item is
	  related to the one before it, or both. (promotion to themes would occur when
	  two groups are being compared/related.)

What does a group represent?
	- some sense of entity/oneness/unity:
	- gestalt principles (separated by rests; in a different range; texturally 
	  unique)
	- constraints (a single pitch class set; only quarter notes; etc)
	- a repeated pattern

What do successive instances of a group represent?
	- variation
		- variations on an underlying, hidden, but stationary archetype (theme)?
	- development
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_development
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_form
	- developing variation
		- evolutions/changes (complications/extensions/complixifications) of an 
		  intial simple idea?
		- variations are produced through the development of existing material
		- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_variation

Correspondences between groups may not be strictly top-down, decompositional
	- Maybe motifs, themes get labeled and a copy is put on a shelf, and then
	  new instances get the same label, with a new instance ID.  There could
	  be a new theme composed of a previous theme, plus a variation of an old
	  motif, plus a new motif. 
	- Things only get labeled as motifs, themes when they're seen a second 
	  time?

### Heuristics for grouping / splitting

Split groupings at
	- moments of high surprise

Split groupings at
	- the beginning or end of long IOIs
	- bar lines

Gestalt principles (look to GTTM for more)
	- similarity - in A.A.B, prefer to group A.A vs A.B
	- proximity - in A.B..C, prefer to group A.B vs. B..C
	- closure - ABC.D is more likely a group than is ABC.A 
	- good continuation - A.BxCy.z should produce overlapping A.B.C and x.y.z
	- common fate - AxyBxyCxyD should produce interleaved A..B..C..D and xy.xy.xy ??
	- good form - ?

Groups should be homogeneous:
	- Groups at a given abstraction-height should all have similar length
	- Groups at different heights should have lengths in mostly non-overlapping 
	  ranges
